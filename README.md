# London-Bike-Sharing-Data-Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of London's bike-sharing data. It involves data cleaning and feature engineering to derive new insights, such as seasonal names, timestamps, and a new column to categorize weekends and holidays. The core of the analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), including calculating and printing descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix to identify relationships between different features. Finally, it provides a deeper look into the data by calculating and printing the average difference between 'real' and 'feels like' temperatures (t_diff) for each season.

# K-Means Clustering on Bike-Sharing Data
This project demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment London's bike-sharing data. It processes the data by selecting key features, cnt (bike count) and t1 (real temperature), and then applies min-max scaling and noise addition to prepare the dataset for clustering. The K-Means algorithm is implemented from scratch, including functions for choosing initial centroids, assigning data points to clusters, and recomputing centroids. The project runs the algorithm for different numbers of clusters (k=2,3,5) and visualizes the results to show how the data points are grouped, with the centroids marked for each cluster.
